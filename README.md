# Graphical_captcha_java

# Captcha-As-Graphical-passwords
This project generates a simple graphical captcha in Java using the frame. The captcha is displayed in a JLabel component and consists of a random combination of uppercase letters and digits. The user is then asked to enter the captcha in a JTextField and click the Submit button. If the user's input matches the captcha string, a message dialog is shown indicating that the captcha verification was successful, and the captcha frame is closed. If the user's input is incorrect, a message dialog is shown indicating that the captcha is invalid, and a new captcha string is generated and displayed in the JLabel.
